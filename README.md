# go-mpv

> Go bindings for [libmpv](https://mpv.io/).

This fork has diverged from upstream (**gen2brain/go-mpv**) - it will continue focusing on CGo and maintain support for `mpv_node` APIs to meet the needs of the [Supersonic](https://github.com/dweymouth/supersonic) and [STMPS](https://github.com/spezifisch/stmps) projects.
